# showcase
A showcase of some of the projects that I have worked on over the years for personal interests or classes.

**Pokemon Trainer**
> Using an OOP style of coding, create a simplified version of the classic Pokemon game to be played on terminal.

**Random Acts of Pizza**
> Attempt at the 2015 Kaggle Competition that challenged participants to create a model to predict whether or not a Reddit user would receive pizza or not based on his/her post.

**Multi-Genre Classification using RobertA**
> Design a model that predicts out multiple genres for a single film based on that filmâ€™s plot description. (Multi-label classification project)
